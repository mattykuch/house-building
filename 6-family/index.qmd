In Uganda and in the wider African context, the family is often a pillar of support, not just emotionally but financially as well. It’s common for families to pool resources for significant life events— like weddings, which are a well-known example of this. Family members willingly contribute to ensure the event is a success.

My belief has always been that in much the same way, this culture of familial support can be applied to building a home. After all, a house is not just a personal milestone; it’s a long-term asset that benefits the entire family.

Many Ugandans find it easy to ask family for support when it comes to weddings but few consider tapping into this same network when building a home. Weddings are seen as communal events and contributions flow more freely. However, when it comes to house construction, people often feel hesitant; fearing that the contributions will come with too many expectations or strings attached. Yet, the truth is that building a home—like a wedding—is a significant milestone that could benefit from the same sense of collective family responsibility.

The challenge, however, lies in expanding that mindset and being willing to ask for help not just for one day of celebration but for something that could last a lifetime—a home.

## Leveraging existing cultural practices

African families have a strong culture of coming together for important life events. Whether it’s a kwanjula (traditional introduction ceremony), wedding or a funeral, relatives are often quick to offer financial support. This same spirit can be applied to house construction where family members may be willing to contribute money, labor or even land.

Uncle Mo likes to say that it's an open secret that many young couples in Kampala successfully built their first home through family contributions. Contributions come in not only as money but also in the form of land to build, materials and even advice. By relying on these non-cash contributions, many have managed to cut their building costs by nearly 20%.

## Expectations and strings attached

However, just like with wedding contributions, family support for a house can come with unspoken expectations. Family members might feel entitled to visit or stay at your home whenever they please, or they may expect future favors in return such as financial support for their own projects.

Uncle Mo told me a story once, of a man who accepted land from his father to build his house but later found himself in a difficult situation when his siblings assumed they could build on the same plot. This led to conflicts about property ownership which could have been avoided with clear communication and boundaries from the start.

## Set expectations early and embrace collective responsibility

The key to successfully navigating family contributions lies in transparency and setting clear expectations. Just as you would have discussions about the financial contributions for a wedding, you need to communicate openly about contributions toward building your house. Let your family know what kind of support you need whether it’s money, materials or land. Be clear about ownership and boundaries from the start to avoid misunderstandings later.

By treating the house construction as a communal effort, much like a wedding, you can harness the power of family support without compromising your independence. Building a home is a shared milestone and when approached with clear communication, it can strengthen family bonds just as much as a grand celebration.

## Practical Tips – Chapter 6:

-   **Frame the request like a wedding contribution:** Family members are often willing to contribute to large events like weddings, so frame your request for house contributions similarly. Make it clear that this is a communal effort for a long-lasting asset. Interestingly, the shell of a moderate 3- bedroom house costs about the same as a wedding budget.

-   **Explore non-cash contributions:** Family contributions don’t always have to come in the form of money. Materials like cement, bricks, or land can be just as valuable, so don’t hesitate to ask for these types of support.

-   **Have open conversations about ownership:** If you’re accepting land or other significant contributions, be clear about ownership and any expectations your relatives might have. Set boundaries early to avoid future conflicts.

-   **Show gratitude and involvement:** Regardless of the size or type of contribution, show appreciation to your family members. Keeping them informed and involved in the process, even in small ways, can help maintain a sense of shared responsibility and pride in the project.

Always remember that the idea of family contributions extends beyond cash. From weddings to housebuilding, it’s about collective responsibility. By approaching your house project as a family milestone, you can tap into a well-established cultural practice of support, ensuring that your dream home becomes a shared success
