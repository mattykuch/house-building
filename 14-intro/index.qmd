In contemporary African society, in which I was born, one of the many unspoken expectations of growing up is to leave your parental home and start cleaving on your own. Staying on your own usually means renting a simple room or apartment for starters but to truly be considered independent and successful, one must build their own home. This is applicable for all ages young or old in rural areas as well as urban dwellers.

As a special note of information, across the country, urbanization and economic growth are fueling a renewed interest in contemporary housing, with many desiring for a great balance in spaces that are affordable, sustainable and of outstanding functionality.

The issue, for many, is that it’s not so easy to find guidance on what it takes to successfully build a modern house. More so, to do it in an efficient and cost-effective way in a burning economy like ours. There is no convenient or easy-to-access spring of knowledge from which to drink and miraculously understand what it takes to build a modern house. If there is, chances are slim that such material is yet to reach out to those in need of it.

That’s why I was motivated to write this book to take the reader through the journey of building a modern house and in the process save you some money and frustration.

This book is divided up into 3 main parts:

-   **Part 1: The Vision** – covers the initial phase of imagining and planning how your house should look like.

-   **Part 2: The Money** - covers the issue of how to finance your building project.

-   **Part 3: The Building** – covers the different phases of constructing a house.

As I write this book, I do not purport to be an authority on the science and art of house construction – but I do have some valuable practical lessons I have learned from others and from building my own home.

My overall goal after you complete this book is that you will have expanded your knowledge of house construction but most of all, avoided the pitfalls of walking in the house building journey blindfolded.

Let’s begin!
